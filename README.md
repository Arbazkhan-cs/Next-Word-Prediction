# Next-Word-Prediction

Next-Word-Prediction is a natural language processing (NLP) project that predicts the next word in a sequence of text. It leverages deep learning techniques to analyze patterns in large text corpora and generate accurate predictions.

## Introduction

Next-Word-Prediction is designed to enhance text generation tasks by suggesting probable next words based on the context of the input text. Whether you're building chatbots, autocomplete features, or text generators, Next-Word-Prediction provides valuable insights into the likely next words, improving the flow and coherence of generated text.

## Key Features

- Uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for accurate prediction.
- Supports variable-length input sequences and dynamically adapts to different contexts.
- Trained on large text datasets to capture diverse language patterns and nuances.
- Provides customizable options for model fine-tuning and optimization.
- Offers an intuitive interface for easy integration into existing applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Streamlit (for the web interface)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

## Usage

To use Next-Word-Prediction, simply input a sequence of text into the provided interface. The model will then generate and display the most probable next word based on the input context. You can adjust the number of predicted words and experiment with different input sequences to observe the model's behavior.
